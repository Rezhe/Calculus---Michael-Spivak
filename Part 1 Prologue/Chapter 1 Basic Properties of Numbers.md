(P1) If a, b, and c are any numbers, then

$$ a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c $$\

(P2) If a is any number, then

$$a + 0 = 0 + a = a $$\

(P3) For every number a, there is a number -a such that 

$$ a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0 $$\

(P4) If a and b are any numbers, then

$$ a + b = b + a $$\

(P5) If a, b and c are any numbers, then

$$ a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c $$\
